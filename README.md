This repo is used to record my learning about secure multiparty computing. **This repo is highly referenced to the repo of [mpc4j](https://github.com/alibaba-edu/mpc4j)**, and I think it is the best open source project in the field of secure multiparty computing at present. If you are interested in secure multi-party computing, I strongly suggest you have a look at [mpc4j](https://github.com/alibaba-edu/mpc4j).

This repo mainly contains some protocols implemention in secure multi-party computing and homomorphic encryption. Such as: Oblivious Transfer(OT), Privacy Set Intersection(PSI), ABY3, Paillier, etc. At the same time, I am a beginner of rust. Therefore, in order to master rust better, I use rust to implement these protocols.
